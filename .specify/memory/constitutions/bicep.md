# Bicep Development Constitution

**Version**: 0.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-18 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-18

This document defines the mandatory principles and practices for all Bicep infrastructure code in the Okane project.

## Status

This constitution is a **placeholder** for future Bicep-specific principles. As Bicep is introduced to the project, this document will be expanded to include:

- Bicep coding standards and conventions
- Module organization and reusability requirements
- Parameter and variable naming conventions
- Resource naming standards
- Testing and validation requirements
- Documentation standards
- Security and compliance requirements

## Placeholder Principles

### I. Infrastructure as Code Standards

**TO BE DEFINED**: Specific Bicep coding standards will be established when Bicep is introduced to the project.

### II. Module Organization

**TO BE DEFINED**: Bicep module structure, reusability, and composition patterns will be documented.

### III. Testing and Validation

**TO BE DEFINED**: Requirements for Bicep template testing, validation, and deployment procedures.

## Governance

This constitution will be expanded when Bicep infrastructure code is introduced to the Okane project. Until then:

- This file serves as a placeholder to maintain constitution structure consistency
- Any Bicep code introduction MUST be accompanied by a comprehensive update to this constitution
- Principles from the main constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) apply as general guidance
